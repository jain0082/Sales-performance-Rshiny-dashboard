# Sales-performance-Rshiny-dashboard

Data visualization is the cornerstone of data mining, charged with the responsibility of conveying value. Visualization is the key to the data science process, delivering the solutions in a neat, easy to understand representation of days, weeks and sometimes months of work. 

Having worked with Tableau extensively, I wanted to explore a more hands-on tool that required writing codes to produce a customized result in the form of a dashboard. RShiny, with its ever increasing funcationalities was a great tool to learn. While it was a bit difficult to catch on, and a lot less intuitive than the traditional drag-and-drop tools like Tableau or PowerBI, I had a lot of fun exploring the various features available in RShiny. 

This is an ongoing project, and I am continuously working on improving the design, functionality and appeal of the visuals I create. 

In this dashboard, I am exploring a Sales performance dataset, which has monthly budget and actual sales values for a retailer. The dataset contains a granularity of Month, Sales Channel and Product Category, with 3 years of data. This data has been simulated, and I'm working on making it as close to an expected sales dataset.
